### 🚀 About Me

- 🧠 Self-taught, hands-on learner — I believe the best way to learn is by **shipping real apps**.
- 🧩 I’m not into buzzwords — just clear code, strong architecture, and meaningful UI.
- 📱 Obsessed with how code feels on screen — whether it’s Kotlin on Android or React in the browser.
- 🌍 I’m preparing for a top-tier role in a **global software house** — and I’m getting there one commit at a time.

## 💬 Developer Philosophy

> *"If it’s not useful, it’s noise. If it’s not readable, it’s a liability. If it’s not real, it’s not worth showing."*
